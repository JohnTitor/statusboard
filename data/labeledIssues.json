From the evidence presented here, I think it is a waste of time to try and wake the project up with its current leadership.","createdAt":"2019-06-15T20:07:56Z","updatedAt":"2019-08-31T09:36:38Z","closedAt":null,"labels":[{"name":"discussion","color":"e5894b"},{"name":"help wanted","color":"008672"}],"assignee":null,"author":{"login":"jsumners","avatarUrl":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/321201?v=4","url":"https://github.com/jsumners"}},"project":{"name":"nodejs/package-maintenance","repo":"nodejs/package-maintenance","repoOwner":"nodejs","repoName":"package-maintenance","repoBranch":"master","repoDirectory":"/","packageName":"package-maintenance"}},{"label":{"name":"help wanted","color":"008672"},"issue":{"owner":"nodejs","repo":"package-maintenance","number":339,"isPullRequest":false,"url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/339","state":"OPEN","title":"[docs] repository settings (new)","description":"In #333 a Table of Contents was added for helping readers and maintainers with organizing content within the docs/ folder.\nIn that ToC was added a new section for documenting best practices, tips and recommendations for library maintainers, like branch permissions, managing access, and other ways to help assist in the maintenance of a repository, GitHub or otherwise.","createdAt":"2020-04-20T01:22:53Z","updatedAt":"2020-05-21T12:53:04Z","closedAt":null,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","color":"008672"}],"assignee":null,"author":{"login":"thescientist13","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/895923?u=ee2417210461abea5b06cf6aea5492220ecdadf7&v=4","url":"https://github.com/thescientist13"}},"project":{"name":"nodejs/package-maintenance","repo":"nodejs/package-maintenance","repoOwner":"nodejs","repoName":"package-maintenance","repoBranch":"master","repoDirectory":"/","packageName":"package-maintenance"}},{"label":{"name":"help wanted","color":"008672"},"issue":{"owner":"nodejs","repo":"package-maintenance","number":341,"isPullRequest":false,"url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/341","state":"OPEN","title":"[docs] workflows (new)","description":"In #333 a Table of Contents was added for helping readers and maintainers with organizing content within the docs/ folder.\nIn that ToC was added a new section for documenting best practices, tips and recommendations for library maintainers, like developer / contributor guidelines, templates, automation and other ways to help assist in the maintenance of a repository, GitHub or otherwise.","createdAt":"2020-04-20T01:35:17Z","updatedAt":"2020-05-21T12:53:22Z","closedAt":null,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","color":"008672"}],"assignee":null,"author":{"login":"thescientist13","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/895923?u=ee2417210461abea5b06cf6aea5492220ecdadf7&v=4","url":"https://github.com/thescientist13"}},"project":{"name":"nodejs/package-maintenance","repo":"nodejs/package-maintenance","repoOwner":"nodejs","repoName":"package-maintenance","repoBranch":"master","repoDirectory":"/","packageName":"package-maintenance"}},{"label":{"name":"help wanted","color":"008672"},"issue":{"owner":"nodejs","repo":"package-maintenance","number":342,"isPullRequest":false,"url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/342","state":"OPEN","title":"[docs] code of conduct (new)","description":"In #333 a Table of Contents was added for helping readers and maintainers with organizing content within the docs/ folder.\nIn that ToC was added a new section for documenting guidelines for effectively creating a good Code of Conduct for a project, as well as including references and examples to showcase, like for NodeJS or this repository itself.","createdAt":"2020-04-20T01:37:09Z","updatedAt":"2020-05-21T12:53:27Z","closedAt":null,"labels":[{"name":"help wanted","color":"008672"}],"assignee":null,"author":{"login":"thescientist13","avatarUrl":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/895923?u=ee2417210461abea5b06cf6aea5492220ecdadf7&v=4","url":"https://github.com/thescientist13"}},"project":{"name":"nodejs/package-maintenance","repo":"nodejs/package-maintenance","repoOwner":"nodejs","repoName":"package-maintenance","repoBranch":"master","repoDirectory":"/","packageName":"package-maintenance"}},{"label":{"name":"help wanted","color":"008672"},"issue":{"owner":"nodejs","repo":"package-maintenance","number":373,"isPullRequest":false,"url":"https://github.com/nodejs/package-maintenance/issues/373","state":"OPEN","title":"draft documentation promotion","description":"We have a number of docs in draft status, but not sure what is left or needed.
